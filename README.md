This project may be used to get data from CSV-files provided for the exercise.
In data_purifier.py you may write your own code below main to analyse the data.

If you want to use external commandline tools for analysis you can get the data from cli_data_purifier.py.
Using "python cli_data_purifier.py NoStego.csv > {target}" you can pipe the cleanded data into a new file or diffrent function.
